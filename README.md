# Invigulus Project
Along with seven other group members, we created a web front-end for a company as part of the Object-Oriented Software Development Certificate at SAIT, toward the beginning of the program.
With some help from team members, I contributed the registration page (with HTML, CSS and Javascript), but not its backend interaction with a database.
